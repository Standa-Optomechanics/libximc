Building a library for Windows

Dependencies

* Download and install GIT from https://git-scm.com in C:\Program Files\Git (should be the default).
* Download and install CMake https://cmake.org in C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake. 
You can put the 64 bit version in C:\Program Files\CMake, and then just copy it to C:\Program Files (x86).
* Installing cygwin
The installation must be done in the C:\cygwin (this is the default).
It is necessary to select flex, bison, bash packages for installation. 
The archive with the verified version can be downloaded at https://files.xisupport.com/libximc_dependencies/cygwin_ci.7z, 
then just unpack the archive on the C:\drive.
* Install JDK 7-9 64 bits if not installed. A proven Java distribution can be downloaded 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/javaclientmsiinstallers/files/Java%20JDK%209%20Update%20464/jdk9.0.464.zip/download
or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase9-archive-downloads.html. Authorization is required to download from the second link.
Prescribe the variable JDK_PATH
Example: JDK is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4 
=> Start -> PC Software Computer -> Properties -> Additional system parameters -> Environment Variables -> System variables,
there we create a variable JDK_HOME and JDK32_HOME with the value C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4
* It is necessary to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.

Building a library for Ubuntu (Debian based)

The following instruction has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 23.04.

I. Install dependencies

    1. Install lsb_release:
        sudo apt install lsb-release

    2. Install build essentials:
        sudo apt install build-essential

    3. Install git:
        sudo apt install git

    4. Install make and cmake:
        sudo apt install make
        sudo apt install cmake

        Note: if you are using Ubuntu 14, instead of "sudo apt install cmake" use
        "sudo apt install cmake3"

    5. Install autotools:
        sudo apt install autoconf autotools-dev libtool libglib2.0-dev

    6. Install flex and bison:
        sudo apt install flex bison

    7. Install doxygen and latex:
        sudo apt install doxygen
        sudo apt install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-lang-cyrillic

    8. Install Java:
        8.1. Install Java 8:
            sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
	
        8.2. Or in case Java 8 is unavailable, install Java 7:
            sudo apt install openjdk-7-jdk

        Note: You should use Java 7 or 8. So in case your system use another version, after installation
        of Java 7(8) one extra action may be needed -- set default Java version to 7 (or 8) using
        "update-alternatives --config java".

II. Build

    * Only library:
        ./build.sh libfast
    
    * Library and its docs:
        ./build.sh lib


Working with the library

* Cloning the repository: 
  git clone https://github.com/EPC-MSU/libximc
* We switch to the desired state using git checkout
* From the library folder, run the: 
  build.bat
* The result of the assembly can be taken in \ximc
